## AWS

My IP address is: 100.28.122.201

I first hooked in everything before I actually got the domain and so it took a little while for the dns records to "propagate"
This is a useful website [Whats My DNS.net](https://www.whatsmydns.net).

## Caddy

No problems worked just like it said in the [instruction](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/webServers/https/https.md).
I did have some issues trying to configure neovim to use instead of vim since I don't use qwerty but I stripped down my config and got something that I can at least use.

## HTML

I have some experience in HTML so it was not hard to design things with CSS in mind for the future.
Because of my experience, it didn't take that long add things.
The only annoying part was adding an image because I didn't want to grab random ones off the internet for copyright reasons.
Instead I figured out how to draw svgs and drew a circle with a circle cut out of it.
I stubbed out an example board that will be the template for the other boards. 
I also added a login screen to the username link but that should eventually show a dashboard if the user is already logged in.


## CSS

This took a couple hours to get it how I wanted. It was important to make it responsive and Tailwind helped with that. 

I do have a lot of CSS experience but using a framework drove me insane since it would do all sorts of things I didn't want it to do. I felt like I was fighting it the whole time.

## React Part 1: Routing

Setting up Vite and React was pretty simple. I had a bit of trouble because of Tailwind not wanting to work locally but it worked fine once I deployed it.

## React Part 2: Reactivity

I got a few new features that I wanted but didn't implement yet. With some help from an LLM (note some) I was able to add dynamic adding of new image boards. I ended up doing most of the work. I just had it point me in the right direction.
But it is cool seeing real data in everything.
